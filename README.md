### 1. LED CHASERS
  Led CHasers will glow the LED in a particular manner. In this code first all the LED's will glow with some delay in between them then turn off all the LED's with some delay. This process will execute in a loop. For this whole execution 8051 microcontroller is used.

### 2. PRINT STRING ON SCREEN
  This program will print any string on the LCD screen. I have printed the 'MPI ASSIGNMENT' on the screen. But you have to make sure the your data lines of the LCD will be connected to P0 port of the 8051 microcontroller, and EN pin on P2.1 and RS pin on P2.0
